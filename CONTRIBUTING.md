Welcome!
Welcome to "The Game's" Group Three's "Right Room" Contributing file, part of IT 115 Class project! Our group is one of four groups, creating one of the Game's four rooms. We have four members. "The Game" is an open source project for students in IT 115. The goal of the project is to learn to create and collaborate web application code on GitHub.

Environment Details
Part of the class is to explore different development environments. This repository will be for code contributions from our Group 3 members, to contribute back to the class repository at @rbunge-nsc/thegame [https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/the-game]

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.

Testing
You can test the latest version of The Game at this URL:

[http://the-game-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html]

Our current testing procedure is to click on each link and check for broken links and missing pages.

Bug Reports
TBD

Code of Conduct
Please respect the Game's purpose and design structure. The design structure is described below.

At the top of the structure will be:
index.html

CONTRIBUTING.md
Our Group 3, the right room, directories for each author:
tunnel1 - @KBish001
tunnel2 - @Alannao

Our group directory will point back to instructors directories. There Index.html will point to one landing page in each group's directory:
group1 > front.html
group2 > back.html
group3 > right.html
group4 > left.html
bob > cave.html
Reminders from Professor Bunge:
Be sure to keep your group's content in it's own folder! Also be sure to fix any broken links in your group's folder! Any stray files or directories left at the top level will be deleted.
